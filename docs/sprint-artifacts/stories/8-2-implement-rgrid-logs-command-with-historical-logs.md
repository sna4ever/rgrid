# Story 8.2: Implement `rgrid logs` Command with Historical Logs

Status: ready-for-dev

## Story

As developer,
I want to view stdout/stderr logs for any execution,
So that I can debug failures.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given** execution has completed
2. When** I run `rgrid logs exec_abc123`
3. Then** CLI fetches logs from execution_logs table
4. And** displays logs in chronological order with timestamps
5. And** shows both stdout and stderr interleaved
