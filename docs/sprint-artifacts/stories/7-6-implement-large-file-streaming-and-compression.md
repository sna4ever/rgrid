# Story 7.6: Implement Large File Streaming and Compression

Status: ready-for-dev

## Story

As developer,
I want large files (>100MB) handled efficiently,
So that uploads/downloads don't time out or consume excessive memory.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given** output file is >100MB
2. When** runner uploads file
3. Then** file is streamed (not loaded into memory)
4. And** file is compressed with gzip
5. And** download automatically decompresses
