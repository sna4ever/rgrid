# Story 7.4: Auto-Download Outputs to Current Directory (Single Execution)

Status: ready-for-dev

## Story

As developer,
I want single execution outputs downloaded automatically to current directory,
So that it feels like local execution.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given** I run `rgrid run process.py input.json` (single execution)
2. When** execution completes
3. Then** CLI automatically downloads all outputs to current directory
4. And** files appear as if script ran locally
5. And** CLI displays: "✓ Downloaded: output.json (1.2 MB), results.csv (0.5 MB)"
