# Story 8.4: Implement CLI Reconnection for WebSocket Streams

Status: ready-for-dev

## Story

As developer,
I want to reconnect to log streams if network drops,
So that I don't lose visibility into long jobs.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given** WebSocket connection drops during streaming
2. When** CLI detects disconnection
3. Then** CLI automatically reconnects within 5 seconds
4. And** CLI resumes streaming from last received log line
5. And** no logs are skipped or duplicated
