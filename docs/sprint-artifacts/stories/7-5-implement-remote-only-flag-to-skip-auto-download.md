# Story 7.5: Implement --remote-only Flag to Skip Auto-Download

Status: ready-for-dev

## Story

As developer,
I want to skip automatic downloads for large outputs,
So that I can selectively download later.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given** I run `rgrid run script.py --remote-only`
2. When** execution completes
3. Then** CLI does NOT download outputs
4. And** CLI displays: "✓ Execution complete. Outputs stored remotely."
5. And** CLI shows command: "Download with: rgrid download exec_abc123"
