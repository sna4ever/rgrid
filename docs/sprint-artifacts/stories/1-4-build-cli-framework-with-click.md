# Story 1.4: Build CLI Framework with Click

Status: ready-for-dev

## Story

As developer,
I want a CLI framework using Click with proper command structure and error handling,
So that users can execute `rgrid` commands with intuitive interface.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given** the cli/ package structure
2. When** CLI is installed via `pip install -e cli/`
3. Then** `rgrid` command is available globally
4. And** `rgrid --version` shows current version
5. And** `rgrid --help` lists all available commands
