# Story 9.1: Implement MICRONS Cost Calculation

Status: ready-for-dev

## Story

As developer,
I want costs stored as integers (microns) for exact precision,
So that billing is accurate to the fraction of a cent.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given** worker has hourly cost (e.g., €5.83/hour = 5,830,000 micros/hour)
2. When** execution completes
3. Then** cost is calculated:

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1 (AC: #1)
  - [ ] Subtask 1.1
- [ ] Task 2 (AC: #2)
  - [ ] Subtask 2.1
